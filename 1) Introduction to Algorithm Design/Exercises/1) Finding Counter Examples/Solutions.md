### 1-1) Show that a + b can be less than min(a,b)
In a scenario where the __a__ and __b__ are always less than 0, then this case is valid.  
**Example:**  
a = -1 and b = -4  ,   
a + b = -(1+4) = -5  
min(a,b) = min(-1, -4) = -4

-5 < -4 Hence Proved

### 1-2) Show that a * b can be less than min(a,b)
In a scenario where the __a__ and __b__ are one positive and one negative numbers, then this case is valid.  
**Example:**  
a = -1 and b = 4  ,   
a * b = -1 * 4 = -4  
min(a,b) = min(-1, 4) = -1

-4 < -1 Hence Proved
